# Security, IAM & Permission Diagnosis

Find why access was denied by walking the permission chain. On AWS this is
**Explicit Deny → SCP → IAM → Bucket Policy → ACL → Block Public Access (→ KMS)**;
on OSS/BOS/COS the model is RAM/CAM + bucket policy/ACL — confirm the provider
first, because the layer names differ.

## Decision tree

```
403 AccessDenied (credentials are valid) →
  ├─ Message says "explicit deny"         → a Deny statement wins; find it
  ├─ Message says "no policy allows"       → missing Allow on identity OR resource
  ├─ Cross-account?                         → BOTH sides must grant
  │     ├─ caller identity policy allows the action + resource?
  │     └─ target bucket policy grants the caller principal?
  ├─ Object is SSE-KMS / SSE-C?             → also needs kms:Decrypt on the key
  ├─ Public/anonymous access expected?      → Block Public Access / bucket ACL
  └─ Works for some keys, not others        → prefix-scoped policy condition
```

## Investigate with your read-only tools

- `test_credentials` — confirm the keys are valid and see the identity reached.
  If this fails, it's an auth problem, not a policy one — switch to
  `storageops-s3-protocol-compatibility` (signature) or
  `storageops-network-endpoint-access`.
- `head_bucket` — does the denial happen at the bucket level or only on objects?
- `head_object` on a specific key — confirm a per-key 403 vs 404, and read the
  object's storage class / SSE state (KMS-encrypted objects need key access).
- `review_bucket_security` (or `get_bucket_config_summary`) — read the bucket's
  policy/ACL/public-access-block/encryption posture and point to the layer that
  blocks. For a full posture check run `review_bucket_config` (inline,
  read-only); to enumerate the whole account, run `survey_account`.
- `get_object_acl` — for "is THIS object public / who can read it?": reads ONE
  object's ACL and flags an `AllUsers` **or `AuthenticatedUsers`** grant as
  public (an object can be public even under a locked-down bucket). Grantees are
  reduced to a KIND — no owner/canonical id leaks. Use `get_object_tagging` when
  a tag-scoped policy is in play.
- `get_bucket_config_detail` (aspect `policy_status` / `acl` / `ownership` /
  `policy` / `public_access_block`) — read the config instead of asking for it:
  `policy_status` is **AWS's own IsPublic verdict for the bucket policy** (policy
  only — pair it with `acl`, which lists every grant as grantee KIND +
  permission, to cover ACL-public buckets); `ownership` tells you whether ACLs
  are disabled entirely (`BucketOwnerEnforced`, the recommended posture — if so,
  skip the ACL layer in the chain); `policy` gives per-statement
  effect/actions/`is_public`; `public_access_block` the four PAB booleans.
- `query_account_profile` — for account-wide exposure ("which buckets have no
  public-access-block?"): filters the last survey's persisted posture matrix
  (e.g. `missing_public_access_block`) across ALL buckets without re-scanning.

You read configuration; you cannot read the caller's IAM/RAM identity policy — so
identity-side denials must be confirmed from the policy document the user shares.

## Ask the user (only what tools can't reveal)

- The exact error body (code + message + request id) and the S3 action attempted.
- The principal (IAM role/user ARN, or RAM/CAM identity) making the call.
- The identity policy and/or bucket policy JSON (account ids redacted).
- Whether it's cross-account, and whether a VPC endpoint is involved.

## Public-exposure pass (the mirror image of "access denied")

The same authorization chain answers the opposite question — "is this bucket/
object exposed to the world?" — which is worth a deliberate pass on any security
review, not just when a 403 is reported:

- **Start with `review_bucket_security`** — it reads the policy verdict
  (`policy_is_public`, AWS's GetBucketPolicyStatus judgement of the policy), the
  ACL grants, PAB, and Object Ownership in one pass, and emits a combined
  `publicly_exposed` verdict only when both the policy verdict AND the ACL were
  readable. Trust that over hand-reasoning; fall back to the chain below only to
  explain WHY.
- **Public-access block** — is it ON at both account and bucket level? A missing
  block is the single biggest exposure risk.
- **Bucket policy** — `aspect='policy_status'` is AWS's own verdict on the
  policy; use `aspect='policy'` per-statement detail to locate the offending
  statement (any `Principal: "*"` allow without a tight condition).
- **ACL** — `AllUsers` / `AuthenticatedUsers` grants are legacy public access
  that a policy-only check misses (the policy verdict does NOT cover them);
  `aspect='acl'` lists each grant as grantee KIND + permission. If
  `aspect='ownership'` shows `BucketOwnerEnforced`, ACLs are disabled and this
  layer is moot.
- **Website / unauthenticated GET** — if anonymous reads are expected (static
  hosting), say so explicitly and scope it; if not, it's a finding.

Report exposure with the same tool-verified-vs-inferred honesty as a denial, and
propose manual remediation (enable BPA, tighten the policy/ACL) — never a script.

## Credential safety

If shared logs contain an Authorization header, AK/SK pair, session token, or a
presigned URL with credentials, stop and warn: the credential is exposed and
must be rotated and the logs redacted. Never propose disabling auth as a fix.

## What to report

The blocked layer (identity / bucket policy / ACL / public-access block / KMS /
explicit-deny), marked tool-verified vs. inferred-from-policy; a manual-only
remediation the user reviews with their security team; a safe read-only way to
confirm the fix; and the evidence that would falsify the diagnosis.
