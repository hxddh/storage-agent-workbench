"""Agent autonomy policy — how much the in-chat Agent does on its own.

The security invariants (no secrets to the model, no free shell/SQL, no
destructive or bucket-wide S3 operations, no object bodies in context) are
enforced *below* this layer and never change with the policy. The policy only
decides, for the actions that are already safe-by-construction, whether the
Agent executes them itself or proposes them for the user to run.

Two policies (default ``autonomous_readonly``):

- ``autonomous_readonly`` (自主) — the Agent EXECUTES read-only runs itself
  (diagnostic, bucket_config_review, account_discovery) and folds the findings
  into its answer.
- ``assisted`` (协助) — the Agent PROPOSES those runs for the user to confirm,
  and does not execute them on its own.

Either way, EXPENSIVE/data-moving work (dataset analysis, evidence
import/download, large scans) and any MUTATING op are never auto-run — they
always require explicit confirmation — and there is no write/destructive tool in
the product at all.

Risk tiers (independent of policy):

- ``SAFE_READONLY``  — read-only runs + the sanitized session report.
- ``EXPENSIVE``      — large scans / evidence download / dataset analysis.
- ``MUTATING``       — any write (not implemented; listed so tiering is total).
